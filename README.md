## Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering

This project demonstrates how to use K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. The dataset contains information about customers including their gender, age, annual income, and spending score. In this project, we focus on clustering customers based on their annual income and spending score.

- CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
- Gender: Gender of the customer
- Age: Age of the customer
- Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars
- Spending Score (1-100): Spending score assigned to the customer based on their purchasing behavior and past interactions
